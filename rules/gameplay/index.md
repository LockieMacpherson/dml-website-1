# Gameplay

A game of Dragon's Money Laundering is governed by series of sequences and subsequences much like a computer program with nested subroutine calls. The game table is divided to Zones that different sequencences interact with. Within the the sequences there are conditional event flows that are resolved by using dice rolling as an arbiter. Sometimes dice rolls might spawn their own subsequences that take place immediately and after resolving they return back to the point in game when they first occured. Every event that might lead to a new subsequence spawning happens in series.

Learning about Dragon's Money Laundering gameplay happens by first understanding the basic concepts introduced in Card Reference section. After that a Player needs to know all legal Zones where cards can be located during the game, and a Player needs to know the special rules concerning Dice Rolling and the more unconventional Victory Conditions.

When a Player knows how to find the aforementioned information quickly, the Player can follow the Game Sequences to the letter and be able to play the game in full.
