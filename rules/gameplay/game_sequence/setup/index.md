## Specific Rules

### Initiative Badge Roll-Off

The Player that happens to have the dice starts the roll-off in counter-clockwise order. The Player that rolls the highest result with two dice gets the Initiative Badge.

If any number of Players are tied for the highest result, they will repeat Initiative Badge Roll-Off until the Initiative Badge position is resolved.

If any Player rolls Dabo, he/she may re-roll both the dice.

If any Player rolls 'Woot! Woot!', immediately interrupt Initiative Badge Roll-Off and that Player receives the Initiative Badge.
