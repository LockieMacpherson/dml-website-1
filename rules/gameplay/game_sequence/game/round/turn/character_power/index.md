# Character Power Sequence

1. The Active Player may play any number of Character Ultimate Powers and/or Emblems in to Resolution Stack.
2. After the Active Player has declared what he/she is going to play each other Passive Player may play their Character Ultimate Powers or Emblems in to the Resolution Stack counter-clockwise from the Active Player.
3. If any Active or Passive Player plays a Character Ultimate Power or an Emblem in to the Resolution Stack, each other Player will have a chance on their respective turn to respond by playing any number of other Emblems or Character Ultimate Powers in to the Resolution Stack. Repeat this process until no Player plays a new Emblem and/or Character Power.
4. Resolve Resolution Stack as defined by Character Power/Emblem Resolution rule.

## Character Power/Emblem Resolution rule

Character Ultimate Powers and Emblems are placed in a last-in-first-out stack called the Resolution Stack. Each subsequently played Emblem or Character Ultimate Power is placed on top of the stack, and after all Emblems and Character Ultimate Powers are played, the cards are resolved from the top to the bottom of the Resolution Stack.
